# Student README file

Problem1- requires Dijkstra.java, Display.java, Edge.java, Vertex.java,and txt files citypairs and cityxy. I did not change any of the classes except for the required Dijkstra
problems, but I did end up calling the getVertices method instead of using the map vertexNames. I realize this isn't the best way of doing things, but I would rather not change 
what I have now, since it works and I have more finals studying to get to.. sorry! Thank you! Compiling and running them the same way as indicated in the readMe file from Prof.
