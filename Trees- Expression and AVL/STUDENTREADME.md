Problem 1- In this problem, I use MyStack, ExpressionTree, and Problem1 java files. I show an example of a postfix expression, the other types of traversal
expressions, and the evaluation. As per piazza, which said run time errors were fine, I let MyStack handle run time exceptions for stacks that had to many 
operators (invalid postfix expressions) and threw an exception when it had too few. No other special comments!

Problem 2- In this problem, I used AvlTree, FileAvl, Problem 2 java files, and test.txt and output.txt for testing. I added a LinkedList of integers
to store the linenumbers, accessed this when indexing a Word, and accessed the list with an iterable to print out in the specific format y'all wanted. 
I don't think I have anything else to declare.
