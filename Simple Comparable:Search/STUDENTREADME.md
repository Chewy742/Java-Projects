Problem 1- Created a rectangle class (added a toString and getPerimeter for ease). 
Checked the findMax with an array of rectangles, correct answer should be 38. 

Problem 2- Binary Search recursively- just like professor did in class, I used binary search to find the first 
instance of x, not all instances. Should run fine, tested a perimeter that only appears once, a perimeter that 
doesn't appear, a perimeter that appears twice (should return the first one)

Problem 3- should run fine with java -Xint problem3. Part A corresponds to the first part of the written problem 
set #3, and so on. Created random n sample sizes. 

Problem 4- I'm doing it right now. Woah. *Mind Blown*
