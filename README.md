# Java-Projects
Classroom and personal projects coded in Java. Short descriptions of the projects are seen below, and README's are available for more information. 

## Shortest_Path_GUIs 
- A project that involved using shortest path algorithms in order to display the route lengths and shortest distances between cities portrayed on a map GUI. 

## Trees 
- Expression trees evaluating post-fix expression using stacks and AVL trees.

## TestKBest 
- Project that involved using priority queues to keep track of the k-largest values of a set of data.

## SpellChecker
- Used HashSets that used information from a given dictionary text file to implement a spell checker. Functionalities include pointing out incorrectly spelled words, as well as giving suggestions for basic spelling mistakes. 

## Stacks and Queues
- Used two fundamental data structures to implement a symbol balancing file to point out symbol discrepancies in java files, as well as an implementation of a TwoStackQueue. 

## Simple Comparable/Search 
- A basic coding project that involved learning Comparables and recursion to search for  values.
