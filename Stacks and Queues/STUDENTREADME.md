# Student README file


Mmmm so I am submitting MyQueue, MyStack, Problem2, Problem2.txt, SymbolBalance, Tests 1-6 java files, TwoStackQueue and TwoStackQueueTester

Problem 1- Submitting MyStack, and SymbolBalance java files as well as Tests 1-6 java files. Regular javac compiling, Symbol Balance should be run as in the read
me, with java SymbolBalance Test1.java, and so on. Returned null if stacks were empty and you tried to pop or peek. Didn't make any other assumptions.

Problem 2- Sumbitting MyQueue interface provided, TwoStackQueue, Problem 2 and Problem2.txt. Run with javac compiling and regular running (I never really know what I 
should say when yall ask how to run stuff). TwoStackQueueTester and Problem 2 test various methods within the TwoStackQueue class, I've written the appropriate displays
in the comments within them. 

Student Read Me- doing it now. woah. allo!
