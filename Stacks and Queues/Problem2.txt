For the TwoStackQueue, 

the enqueue method is always the same- it is O(1) and requires a simple push onto the "enqueue" stack.

The dequeue method will vary somewhat. At times when the dequeue stack is empty, the dequeue stack will push onto itself all the 
data from the enqueue stack, in order to reverse the order so that the first item in is now the first to be removed (like a queue). 
This part is order O(N) time, because the time to pop everything off and push it on another grows with the size of the enqueue stack . 

At that point, the dequeue method will not need to do anything until it is empty- until a user has called dequeue enough times to get rid 
of all the items that were pushed onto the dequeue stack. This means its of O(1) time, where the user can just pop off until the dequeue stack 
is empty. At this point, if the dequeue stack is empty, but there are items in the enqueue stack, the dequeue stack will need to take all the data from the 
enqueue stack again, which is the same function as the first time we dequeued (O(N)).
